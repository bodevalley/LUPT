Disabling root User
- Using your new user with sudo privileges, modify etc/passwd
- Change /usr/bin/zsh of root to /usr/sbin/nologin in file 
- Save /etc/passwd
- Confirm the change has been made by trying to log into root

- Keep passwords recorded of created users in Excel
- Change jumphost password ASAP
- Look for backdoor executables on systems
- LinPEAS/other scripts to scan machines for vulnerabilities to patch (Probably won’t need to)
- Single User Mode 
- Check logs of systems for unauthorized logins
Commands:
last- checks last login attempts (man last to see switches)
sudo lastb- displays bad login attempts
